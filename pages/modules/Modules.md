# Modules

The UCP knows two types of extensions, plugins and modules. While plugins contain mostly user content like AIs and maps and have no direct access to the games code, modules use the UCP3 backend core to bind to the game directly and provide functionalities that can be used by plugins.

These pages will contain information and data to individual modules.

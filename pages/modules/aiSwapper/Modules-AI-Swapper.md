# AI-Swapper

The aiSwapper-module provides a new way to switch AIs in the game without having to replace game files. Unlike before, AIs do not need to be created for a special slot. Instead, they use an extra [[format|Modules-AI-Swapper-Format]].

AIs can be provided as a plugin for the user to freely place them in one of the sixteen AI slots the game provides and can also be set to be applied with plugin-provided configurations.
